# A Practical Proxy Signature Scheme

A python implementation of a proxy signature scheme that leverages the Schnorr signature algorithm for the steps of signature and verification [1]. 
A proxy signature protocol allows an entity, called the designator or original signer, to delegate another entity,
called a proxy signer, to sign messages on its behalf, in case of say, temporal absence, lack of time or computational power, etc. The delegated proxy signer can compute a proxy signature that can be verified by anyone
with access to the original signerâ€™s certified public key [2]. The construction of this protocol was built by referencing Aboud et al's work for a loose framework of the proxy signature scheme [3]. The main diversion of this protocol is the replacement of Aboud's signing and verifying methods with our own use of Schnorr's algorithm. Where Aboud provides simplicity, there is also a lack of formality. For those interested in the theories behind Proxy Signature I have provided below a list of works that are better suited for study.
